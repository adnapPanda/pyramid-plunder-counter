# Pyramid Plunder Counter
This plugin will display how many golden chests and sarcophagi you have sucessfully looted in your session. Since recent changes, you are only eligible for a pharaoh's sceptre regardless of whether you successfully looted a chest or sarcophagus.

The plugin shows various different stats on your progress towards a pharaoh's sceptre and the thieving pet.
The stats show the following:
- How many chests and sarcophagus you have looted since installing the plugin
- The amount of chests and sarcophagus you have looted since your last sceptre (this number will reset every time you get a sceptre)
- The % chance of having received at least one sceptre and the pet.

Of course you can adjust the plugin config to remove/add any of these to your infobox.

The plugin also allows you to save data between sessions, so when you shut down the game your progress is saved.

Lastly, you can choose to manually reset any of these stats if you want to start the counter from 0 by shift-right clicking the infobox
